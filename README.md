This MonoDevelop addin makes it easy to create and maintain MonoDevelop addins.

To build and install from source, simply run `Install.bat` (Windows) or `Install.sh` (Mac, Linux).

On Linux, the script will create a package that you can install from inside the MonoDevelop editor under Tools->Add-in Manager->Install from file.

Ensure that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to allow your monodevelop library to be found. eg: '/opt/monodevelop/lib'
